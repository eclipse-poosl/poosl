It represents the class of instance nil.<h3>Variables:</h3><div class="indented"></div><h3>Methods:</h3><div class="indented"><p><h4>asJSON():  String</h4>Returns the receiver as a valid JSON (single line) string.</p></div><hr width="50%" align="left"><h2><a id="data-Object"/>Object</h2>This permanent, native class represents the root superclass of any other data class.

The result is equivalent to: (receiver == o) not. It has a special syntax of the form o1 !== o2, where o1 acts as the receiver and o2 as the argument.</p><p><h4>=(o:  Object):  Boolean</h4>Implements the equality relation. For primitive objects (except for Float value nan), = is equivalent to ==. For user-defined classes, it returns true if o is an object of the same class as the receiver and all instance variables of o and the receiver are (recursively) equal as well. Otherwise, it returns false. For non-primitive native classes, the behavior is as defined for the user-defined classes, unless specified differently at the description of the class. It has a special syntax of the form o1 = o2, where o1 acts as the receiver and o2 as the argument.</p><p><h4>==(o:  Object):  Boolean</h4>Implements the identity relation. Returns true in case o refers to the same object as the receiver. Otherwise, it returns false. It has a special syntax of the form o1 == o2, where o1 acts as the receiver and o2 as the argument.</p><p><h4>deepCopy():  Object</h4>For user-defined classes not extending non-permanent native classes, it returns a clone of the receiver as a new object. This means that a new instance of the receiver's class is returned, where each instance variable is assigned to clones in a recursive manner, such that all (indirect) references to the same original object result in references to a single cloned object. The original and cloned data object structures are isomorphic. For primitive classes, the receiver itself is returned. The non-permanent native classes (and any user-defined subclasses) do not support copying and therefore, an error is generated. For non-primitive permanent classes, the behavior is as defined for the user-defined classes, unless specified differently at the description of the class.</p><p><h4>error(s:  String):  Object</h4>This method allows to signal erroneous behavior. Semantically it does nothing, but tools tend to halt execution of a model after this method and show message s to the user.</p><p><h4>assert(b:  Boolean, s:  String):  Object</h4>This method allows to signal erroneous behavior for a condition b. Semantically it does nothing, but tools tend to halt execution of a model after this method when expression b evaluates to false and show message s to the user.</p><p><h4>marshal():  String</h4>Returns a standardized String representation of the receiver. The inverse functionality is implemented as method unmarshal in class String. It can for example be used to communicate arbitrary objects between different POOSL models via files or sockets in a standardized way.</p><p><h4>printString():  String</h4>Returns a String representation of the receiver. It is the typical means used by tools to retrieve a representation of an object to users of those tools. The standard behavior in class Object returns just the class name. This is overridden in subclasses to display more specific information on the object. If the receiver is an instance of a primitive class or class String, the syntactic constant representation of the receiver is returned.</p><p><h4>shallowCopy():  Object</h4>For user-defined classes not extending non-permanent native classes, it returns a shallow copy of the receiver. This means that a new object of the receiver's class is created, for which the instance variables refer to the same objects as the corresponding instance variables of the receiver. For primitive classes, the receiver itself is returned. For non-permanent native classes (and any user-defined subclasses), an error is generated. For non-primitive permanent classes, the behavior is as defined for the user-defined classes, unless specified differently at the description of the class.</p><p><h4>isOfType(s:  String):  Boolean</h4>If s does not refer to the name of an existing data class, an error is generated. In case s does refer to the name of an existing data class, true is returned in case the receiver is of the type associated with the data class with name s and false otherwise.</p></div><hr width="50%" align="left"><h2><a id="data-Observer"/>Observer (extends Object)</h2>This native class extends Object. It can be used to monitor the simulated system and it provides a means for POOSL tools to terminate an execution or interact with other tools based on observation results. Creating a new Observer yields an unregistered observer object. While unregistered it has no effect on execution of a model. Registering an Observer makes it relevant in the condition to terminate the execution. In case method complete has been called for all Observer instances in a POOSL model since their registration (and there is at least one registered Observer), the execution terminates. Execution also terminates when method halt is called for any registered Observer.<h3>Variables:</h3><div class="indented"></div><h3>Methods:</h3><div class="indented"><p><h4>identifyWith(s:  String):  Observer</h4>Sets the Observer's human-readable identity to s.</p><p><h4>identity():  String</h4>Returns the Observer's identity.</p><p><h4>result():  String</h4>This method returns a String representation of the results for the monitored property. Tools typically use it to communicate observer state to external tools. By default, the result of method printString is returned. Method result can be overridden in subclasses to return specific information on the monitored properties.</p><p><h4>register():  Observer</h4>Marks the Observer to be relevant for terminating the simulation. If the Observer executed the complete method before, it is only considered activated until it executes the complete method again.</p><p><h4>deregister():  Observer</h4>Marks the Observer to be irrelevant for terminating the simulation.</p><p><h4>complete():  Observer</h4>Marks the Observer as activated to terminate the simulation. The simulation actually terminates at the moment that all observers were activated by calling method complete since their registration.</p><p><h4>halt():  Observer</h4>The simulation terminates immediately when any registered Observer executes this method.</p><p><h4>isLast():  Boolean</h4>Returns true when the receiver is the last Observer not yet activated.</p></div><hr width="50%" align="left"><h2><a id="data-RandomGenerator"/>RandomGenerator (extends Object)</h2>This native class extends Object.

In case i <= 0, an error is generated.</p><p><h4>randomiseSeed():  RandomGenerator</h4>This method arbitrarily modifies the seed for the sequence of pseudo-random numbers successively produced by calling methods random and randomInt. The exact behavior is implementation dependent, typically setting the seed to a time-dependent value. Note that when the randomiseSeed or seed methods are not used, every instance of this class will produce the same sequence of pseudo random numbers. Using randomiseSeed disables exact reproductions of executions. It returns the receiver.</p><p><h4>seed(i:  Integer):  RandomGenerator</h4>Sets the seed of the receiver to i.
